# CF Links Changelog

## 1.3.1

- Security updates. Broken tag, do not use.

## 1.3.0

- Resolved issue with large page load times due to 'init' being utilized to build data store on each page load.  Instead, moved into '`admin_init`' action, and only ran on links page. **Large Speed Boost**
- Moved admin css and js into separate files, and added filters for each
- Added version and directory constants

## 1.2.1

- Added 'Modal' type (NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION)
- Fixed bug with 'Current' page.  WordPress always has trailing slashes at the end of its urls, so for the 'current' matching, we had to add a 'trailingslashit' function.
